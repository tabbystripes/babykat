Success! 

Converted it to an Electron program.   
EPC_Launcher is a bat file that should open the cmd line and run it.  Need to have node and electron installed for it to work.  
Final project had too many files to upload to git (over 100).  But the exe ran well.  
Next goal: I need to see if I can make an installer for it.
